	<center><u>The Oregon Trail</u></center>
	<div id="intro">This program simulates a trip over the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri to Oregon in 1847.<br><br>
		Your family will cover the 2040 mile Oregon Trail in 5-6 months---if you make it alive.<br><br>
		You have saved $900 to spend for the trip, and you've just paid $200 for a wagon.<br><br>
		You will need to spend the rest of your money on the following items:<br>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li>OXEN - You can spend $200-$300 on your team. The more you spend, the faster you will go because you will have better animals. </li>
			<li>FOOD - The more you have the less chance there is of getting ill.</li>
			<li>AMMUNITION - $1 buys 50 bullets for attacks by animals and bandits, and for hunting food.</li>
			<li>CLOTHING - This is especially needed because of the cold weather you will encounter while you are crossing the mountains.</li>
			<li>MISCELLANEOUS SUPPLIES - This includes medicine and other things you will need for sickness and for emergency repairs.</li>
</ul>
